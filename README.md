LightSteelBlue is a collection of textbook offers. Students can easily create offers to sell or buy a book. Offers are also immediately matched for simple satisfaction.  


#Why LightSteelBlue? 
Not willing to buy a new textbook?  
Tired of waiting for friends to reply?  
Then try LightSteelBlue for easy match making with satisfaction for both parties.   

##Student's Profile
Only allowed student users have access to the offers. Students can create profiles, and this allows their offers to be linked to their profiles. Our system also requires CAS Authentication for security.

##Buy and Sell Books  
Books are bought and sold through offers available. The "Buy Offers" are for students looking for a textbook, and the "Sell Offers" are for students trying to sell their textbook.  
 
##Match Books by Offers  
Books are matched by offers available. Once an offer is made, a match is immediately found. If a perfect match cannot be made, then the next best offer is shown. Even if there are no available offers, once a match is found it will immediately notify you of the offer.
