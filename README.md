#Why LightSteelBlue? 
Not willing to buy a new textbook?  
Tired of waiting for friends to reply?  
Then try LightSteelBlue for easy match making with satisfaction for both parties.   

##Buy and Sell Books  
Books are bought and sold through offers available. The "Buy Offers" are for students looking for a textbook, and the "Sell Offers" are for students trying to sell their textbook.  
 
##Match Books by Offers  
Books are matched by offers available. Once an offer is made, a match is immediately found. If a perfect match cannot be made, then the next best offer is shown. Even if there are no available offers, once a match is found it will immediately notify you of the offer.
